# Project Overview

## Project Description
This is a task management system application built using React with Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Tools Used
- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Shadcn-ui**: UI component library for React.

## App Guidelines

1. **Components**:
  - All components should be modular and reusable.
  - Components should follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

2. **Styling**:
  - Use Tailwind CSS classes to style components.
  - Avoid inline styles unless necessary.

3. **State Management**:
  - Use React's built-in state management for simple applications.
  - For more complex applications, consider using a state management library like Redux or Context API.

4. **Navigation**:
  - Implement navigation using React Router or Vite's routing capabilities.

5. **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for components and hooks using Jest and React Testing Library.
  - Ensure full coverage of your application.

6. **Code Formatting**:
  - Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
  - Configure Prettier to work with ESLint for linting.

7. **Version Control**:
  - Commit changes with descriptive messages.
  - Follow Git best practices, such as feature branches and pull requests.

8. **Documentation**:
  - Document all public APIs and components.
  - Use JSDoc for JavaScript documentation.

9. **Updating the Guide**:
  - Verify and update the guide after each update or change to the application.
